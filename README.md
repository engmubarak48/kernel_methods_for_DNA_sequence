# kernel_methods_for_DNA_sequence
predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor

The reported results in the report (i.e. presentation.pdf), has been improved using mismatch kernel. and by default the code runs on 
mismatch kernel. since it expensive to compute the k of the mismatch kernel, please do not exceed more than k of 13 and mismatch of 2.
